# TypeScript & NextJS Practice Frontend

## Get started

Clone this repo, then run `yarn start`

## What is this project

This is a proof of concept front-end put together to showcase a fully-modernised
developer experience.

If we are starting essentially from scratch, we can set up modern code
practices right away and have them work together to reduce bugs, handle
advanced future cases, and make re-using components and working
collaboratively a breeze.

We get amazing SEO thanks to Next.js's handling of SSR, secure-by-design
authentication from next-auth, fully typed and tested components and
pages, the option of multilanguage (and at the least, re-usable text
strings), self-updating and self-documenting component stories with
design references baked in, and an offline-first PWA experience with
support for push notifications and native API access. On top of all that,
linters help to give us warnings about bad code practices, accessibility
issues, and browser feature support directly from google analytics stats.

I suggest to use a subdomain to deploy this, eventually moving to the main
.com host once you have reached feature-parity.
